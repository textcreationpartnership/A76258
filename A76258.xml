            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Thus affected was that Noble, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (in his way) heavenly diſpoſed, <hi>Henry</hi> late Marqueſſe of <hi>Worceſter:</hi> to play the greateſt prize that ever was played be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween any two, that ever entred within thoſe liſts. Three Diadems were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the Tripple Crowne; and the Tripple Crown with three Scepters; opportunity that lucky gamſter, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſes a game in twenty, was on the Marqueſſes ſide, time and place directed him, how to take points in his own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; the King at that time being in the Marqueſs own houſe at <hi>Ragland,</hi> and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to borrow money to buy bread, after ſo great a loſſe at <hi>Nazeby:</hi> the King being thus put to play the after game, with the old Marqueſſe, was a little miſtruſtful,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169830:9"/> that he had not plaid the fore game with him ſo well, as that he had not thereby prejudic'd the latter: for though the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe and his ſon, were the two ableſt, and moſt forward'ſt ſhoulderers up of the declining Throne, eſpecially the chip of the old block, whoſe diſpoſition expreſſed it ſelf moſt Noble in not caring who had lov'd the King, ſo that he might be but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to love <hi>Alexander;</hi> whom he affected, not only with the loyall reſpects of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject towards his Soveraigne, but alſo, with ſuch paſſionate wayes of expreſſions, and laboriouſneſſe in all good offices, as are wont to be predominant in thoſe, in whom ſimpathy is the the only ground of their affections: yet there were not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome kind of men, who made the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſſe of this Noble-mans Religion, an occaſion of improving their own envies: which though it could never loſe him the leaſt ground in his Maſters good opinion of him (who never would judge no more a Saint by his face, then a Devil by his feet, but both according to their ſeverall ingagements) yet there were ſome things which happened, as having relation to this family, which were not altogether pleaſing; however, though His Majeſty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169830:10"/> came thither, uſher'd by neceſſity, yet he came neither unwelcomed, nor uninvited; and entertained as if he had been more King, by reaſon of ſome late atchive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather then otherwiſe: and though money came from him like drops of bloud, yet he was contented that every drop within his body ſhould be let out at His command, ſo that he might performe ſo meritorious a piece of worke, as (he thought) the being an inſtrument of bringing the Father of of his Country, to be the Son of his Church) would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſouls health. The Marqueſſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe reſolutions within himſelfe, thought to give them breath at the ſame time, that His Majeſtie ſhould make his motion for a further ſupply of money, which he daily and hourly expected, but was deceived in his expectations; for the relation already having reach'd the Kings ear, how an accident had made me no leſs fortunate to his Lordſhip, then in being the meanes of preſerving his Lordſhips perſon, and no inconſiderable fortune then in the ſame venture with him, and how that I preſerved both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in concealing both: for the ſpace that the Moon uſeth to be twice in riding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169830:10"/> of her circuit (the particulars hereof, here to inſert, would tend rather to much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, then any purpoſe, wherefore I further forbear) untill ſuch time as the truſt that providence had repoſed in me, was crowned by the ſame hand, with ſuch ſucceſſe, as brought the Marqueſſe ſafe to his own houſe in peace; which I had no ſooner brought to paſſe, hut the Marqueſs drew from me a ſolemn ingagement, never to leave him ſo long as we both ſhould live, which I was ſo carefull for to obſerve, that I neither left him in life, nor death, faire weather, nor foule, untill ſuch time as he led me; and I laid him, under the ground in <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> in the Sepulcher of his Fathers.</p>
               <p>And it was a ſtrange thing, that during the time that I was thus a bond-ſervant to his Lordſhip, which was for the ſpace of 12 moneths thrice told; the difference in Religion never wrought the leaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his diſpoſals of truſts of the higheſt nature upon me, but his ſpeeches often ſhewed his heart, &amp; his often lending me his ear, that they were both as much mine, as any mans, of which (it ſeemes) His Majeſty being informed, I muſt be the beetle-head, that muſt drive this wedge
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169830:11"/> into the Royall ſtock; and was alſo told, that no man could make a divorce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Babiloniſh garment, and the wedge of gold, ſooner then my ſelf: to be brief, I was ingaged in the buſineſſe; I could neither deny the imployment, nor well tell how to go about it, I not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marqueſſes drift all this while, thought the Marqueſſe had feared nothing more, then what I my ſelf was moſt afraid of, <hi>viz.</hi> That I ſhould be made an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to let the ſame horſe bleed, whom the King Himſelf had found ſo free, that he was unwilling to give him the leaſt touch with his ſpur: howſoever I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and thus began to tell his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; My Lord: the thing that I feared, is now fallen upon me; I am made the unwelcome meſſenger of bad newes, the King wants money: at which word, the Marqueſſe interrupted me, ſaying, <hi>hold Sir, that's no newes: go on with your buſineſſe:</hi> my Lord (ſaid I) there is one comfort yet, that as the King is brought low, ſo are his demands; and like His Army, are come down, from thouſands to hundreds; and from paying the Souldiers of His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to buying bread for Himſelf and His followers: My Lord, it is the Kings owne
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169830:11"/> expreſſion, and His deſire is but three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound: whereupon my Lord made a long pauſe, before he gave me one word of anſwer (I knowing by experience, that in ſuch caſes it was beſt leaving him to himſelf, and to let that nature that was ſo good, worke it ſelf into an act of the higheſt charity, like the Diamond which is only polliſhed with its own duſt) At laſt he called me nearer to him, and asked me, <hi>if the King Himſelf had ſpoken unto me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any ſuch buſineſſe:</hi> to which I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the King Himſelf had not, but others did, in the Kings hearing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaid, <hi>might I but ſpeak unto Him (but I was never thought worthy to be conſulted with, though in matters meerly concerning the affaires of my own Country) I would ſupply His wants, were they never ſo great, or whatſoever they were:</hi> whereupon I told his Lordſhip, that if the King knew as much, he might quickly ſpeak with Him: then ſaid the Marqueſſe, <hi>the way to have Him know ſo much, is to have ſome body to tell Him of it:</hi> I asked his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if he would give me leave to be the informer: he told me he ſpake it to the ſame purpoſe; I haſtened from him, with as much fear of being called back againe, as I did towards the King, with a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169830:12"/> deſire of giving His Majeſtie ſo good an account, of my ſo much doubted em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie.</p>
               <p>Half going, and halfe running through the Gallerie, I was ſtopt in my way, by one Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Syllard,</hi> who told me, that if ever I had a mind to do My Lord <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> and the Gariſon, any good, now was the time: for even now, one of the Kings Ships, had run her ſelf on ground, under the Towne of <hi>Chepſtow:</hi> Calling unto me the Captain of her (one Captain <hi>Hill,)</hi> who related unto me, that upon the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he was forced to fly into the ſanctuarie, of the Kings Quarters, having formerly revolted from the Parliament, (or rather returned to her due obedience) telling me, moreover, that ſhe was fraught with ſtore of goods, and rich commodities, as Sugar, Tobacco, Linnen of all ſortes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the Law in ſuch a caſe appropriated the King, to ſuch a part of her lading, which I better underſtood then, then I can relate unto you now, &amp; that ſhe had many fair braſs, and iron Guns, in her, with proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ammunition, uſefull for the Gariſon, and that for a word ſpeaking, I might have all this of the King, for the uſe of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169830:12"/> the Gariſon, I (conſidering, that it would be nevertheleſſe the Kings, for being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to ſuch an uſe, as alſo the buſineſs I was about) made no doubt, but that I ſhould eaſily beg all this for the <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> in Conſideration of the great charges, his Lordſhip had been at, in entertaining His Majeſtie ſo long: neither was I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for the King granted it willingly.</p>
               <p>But as to the matter in hand, I told His Majeſtie (a part) that I had moved his Lordſhip in matter of money, but found him a little diſcouraged, in regard, that His Majeſtie having been twice at <hi>Ragland,</hi> a moneth at a time, and that at neither of thoſe times, he ever vouchſafed his Lordſhip ſo much honour, as once to call him to Councel, though it was in his own houſe, and muſt needs be acknowledged, to be one who knew the Countrey and the Conſtitution of the inhabitants, better then any other man, that was about His Majeſtie, had reaſon to underſtand; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told the King, I thought his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip lent my motion a deffer ear, then he would have done, if his Lordſhip had not been thought ſo uſeleſſe a creature: and that I perceived his Lordſhip had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have ſome conference with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169830:13"/> which being obtained, I believed, His Majeſties requeſt would be eaſily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his expectations anſwered, in a higher meaſure, then it may be His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie did believe. The King ſaid, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all my hart:</hi> and as to the other buſineſſe, which ſo much troubles my Lord, in troth I have thought it a neglect in Us hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but the true reaſon, why I did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to do ſo, was, becauſe I thought, my Lord of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> did not deſire it; by reaſon of his retiredneſs, unwildineſs of body, and unwillingneſſe of mind to ſtir abroad; and therefore I thought it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to him, to be let alone. I told his Majeſtie, that I did verily believe, that His Majeſtie was in the right, in both reſpects, both of His Majeſties, and his Lordſhips: and that if His Majeſtie had called him to Councel, I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, his Lordſhip would have deſired, to have been excuſed, but yet he did expect, he ſhould have been called: whereupon the King ſaid, I pray tell my Lord of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> that I did not forbear that reſpect unto him, out of any diſeſtimation I had, either of his wiſedome, or loyaltie, but out of ſome reaſons I had to my ſelf, which indeed reflected as much upon my
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169830:13"/> Lord, as they did on me. For had he uſed to have come to the Councel board, it would have been ſaid, that I took no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councel, but what was conveighed unto me, by Jeſuites, by his Lordſhips meanes: and I pray tell him, that that was the true cauſe. I told His Majeſtie that I would, and that I thought it an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cauſe him to believe no leſs, but withall, I intimated to His Majeſtie, that I knew, the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> had an earneſt deſire to have ſome private Conference with His Majeſtie, this night. Which if granted, it might conduce very much to His Majeſties behoof. The King ſaid, <hi>how can that be?</hi> I told His Majeſtie, that my Lord had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived it before his comming to the Caſtle, and told His Majeſtie of the privacie of the convieghance, and that therefore his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had appointed that for his Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and not in the great Tower, which was the roome he moſt eſteemed of in all the Caſtle. Hereat His Majeſtie ſmil'd, and ſaid, <hi>I know my Lords drift, well enough: either he meanes to chide me, or elſe to convert me to his Religion.</hi> Whereupon I told His Majeſtie: I doubted not, but that His Majeſtie was temptation proof as well as he was correction-free, and that he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169830:14"/> might returne the ſame man, he went, having made a profitable Exchange, of gold, and ſilver, for words and ſleepe, at which the King ſuddenly replyed: <hi>I never received any of the</hi> Marqueſs <hi>gold, but it was all weight, and I would have my words to be ſo with him, which cannot be, becauſe I have no time to weigh the matter, much leſs the words, that I ſhall ſpeak concerning it; I muſt expect to find my Lord very well prepared, and all the force that is in argument againſt me. Had I been a ware of it, or could ſtay, I would have taken ſome days labour, to have been as hard for my Lord as I could, and not to have given him ſuch an extemporarie meeting, as both of us muſt be faine to ſteale from ſleep.</hi> Sir, ſaid I, I am imployed by you both, and I muſt do Your Majeſties ſervice as I may. This way I can, otherwiſe I know not. I do not think his Lordſhip expects diſputation, but audience; what he hath to ſay I know not, neither did I know, that he had any ſuch intention, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time that I mov'd his Lordſhip in Your Majeſties behalf; <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>my Lords deſires are granted, and if he have any ſuch intention, I hope to let him know, that I will not be of a Religion, that I am not able to defend againſt any man; and let me heare from you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time and place.</hi> So I departed his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169830:14"/> preſence, giving this pleaſing account unto the <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> who tranſported with joy, commanded me to haſt unto the King, and tell him, that at eleven of the clocke that night he would not faile to attend His Majeſtie in ſuch a place, whether he had given me direction to light His Majeſtie, which place of meeting was known by the name of my Lord Privy-ſeales Chamber, who was father to this <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> and died in it, wherefore this <hi>Marqueſs</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer any man to lie in it afterwards, or ſcarce any body, ſo much as to come into it, which was the reaſon, why this Chamber, at this time, was ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently empty, when all the roomes in the Caſtle were more then full. And withall his Lordſhip inſtructed me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend near upon the time, in the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing room, which was next unto his Lordſhips Bed-chamber, and to clear the Parlour, and the withdrawing room, if any Companie ſhould chance to ſit up ſo long, which was uſuall at that time, through both which rooms my Lord of <hi>Worceſter</hi> was to paſſe, unto the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: where, when I had once brought him, I ſhould leave him, and wait for the Kings comming forth, giving me the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169830:15"/> Key of his Bed-chamber, wherewith he uſed alwayes to locke himſelf in, and never to his laſt would ſuffer any man to lie in the ſame Chamber with him, which happened well for the private managerie of the buſineſſe. And that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, he would lie down upon the bed, and ſee if he could take a nap. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Lordſhip, that I would be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in my endeavours; onely I made this Objection unto his Lordſhip, that it might be, that it might prove, more then I could performe at ſuch a preciſe time, as we were neceſſitated unto; if they ſhould be either unwilling, or think it ſtrange, to be hurried away all upon a ſuddaine; and beſides, ſo doing would draw ſuſpition with it, that may ſet watch-men over the event of our affaires; whereat the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> haſtily made anſwer, I will tell you what you ſhall do, ſo that you ſhall not need to fear any ſuch thing, go unto the Yeomen of the Wine-ſeller, and bid him leave the Keyes of the Wine-ſeller with you, and all that you find in your way, invite them down into the ſeller, and ſhew them the Keyes, and I warrant you, you ſhall ſweep the room of them if their were a hundred. And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169830:15"/> when you have done, leave them there. I thought that Objection ſufficiently ſalved, ſo took my leave, diſpoſing my ſelf to a removeall of all the blocks, that might be caſt in our way, I found not any. The time drawing near, that the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Letter was to diſpute with the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Number, I opened the <hi>Marqueſſes</hi> door, ſo ſoftly (fearing, to wake the two young Gentlemen which waited upon my Lord, and were in bed and a ſleep in the next roome, through which we were to paſſe, and were reſolved to put it to a venture, whether we could do ſo, or no, but we paſt and repaſt, without any their taking the leaſt notice of us,) that the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> himſelf did not hear me, when I came to him, I found him a ſleep, whom I ſo wakened, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that he would needs perſwade me, that he had not ſlept at all.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169830:16"/> the more he came to himſelf, and to lay ſtronger and ſtronger hold upon him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing a great deal of unwillingneſſe, to that which he formerly ſo much deſired; and with ſuch a kind of reluctancy, as might very well ſpread an appearance of ſome remorſe: I my ſelf began to be a fraid of being made an inſtrument in a deſigne, that carried with it, ſuch a conflict within the boſome of the actor; untill my ſecond thoughts, baniſhed my firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and ſeconded my confidence of his Lordſhips innocence, being confirmed by this following expreſſion of his, <hi>God bleſſe us all: what if we ſhould be diſcovered? what conſtruction would they make of our doings? what advantage would they be ready to take of ſuch conſtructions? what if this harmleſſe and innocent deſigne of mine, ſhould be thought a Conſpiracy, ſuch a one as</hi> Gowries? <hi>then they will take an occaſion to Plunder me of all that I have: I proteſt I never thought of this, I wiſh I never had attempted any ſuch thing:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I told his Lordſhip: that it was too late now to entertaine any ſuch fears, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any ground for any ſuch jealouſie: whereat the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> replyed <hi>fie, fie, I would to God that I had let it alone.</hi> I perceiving this tergiverſation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169830:16"/> out of an awfulneſſe, which his loyal hart, ever carried with it, towards His ſacred Majeſtie, which might very well raiſe doubts of a high nature, out of the manner of the fact, thus ſpake unto his Lordſhip: My Lord, <hi>you know your own heart hest, if there be nothing in your intentions but wbat is good, and juſtifiable, you need not fear, if otherwiſe; it is never too late to repent;</hi> at which words the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> ſeemed to be much troubled, ſaying, <hi>Ah!

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169830:17"/> preſently left my Lord (in the portall, where he would needs be, untill ſuch time as the King were entered the room, and ſhould ſend for him in) and went to the place where I was to expect the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Intimation, which I had formerly given His Majeſtie.

                  <p>Come I ſee I muſt come nearer to you: Sir, It is thus, God expected a worke to be done by your hands, but you have not anſwered his expectation, nor his mercy towards you, when your Enemies had more Cities and Gariſons, then you had private families to take your part, when they had more Cannon then you had Muskets; when the people crowded to heap treaſures agaidst you,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169830:20"/> whilst your Majeſties friends were faine here and there to make a gathering for You, when they had Navies at Sea, whilſt Your Majeſty had not ſo much as a Boat upon the River; whilſt the odds in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber against you was like a full crop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a gleaning, then God wrought his miracle, in making Your gleaning big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then their vintage; he put the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into your hand, and made You able to declare Your ſelf a true man, to God, and gratefull to Your friends; but like the man whom the Prophet makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, who beſtowed great cost and paines upon his vineyard, and at laſt it brought forth nothing but wilde grapes; ſo when God had done all theſe things for You, and expected that You ſhould have given his Church ſome reſpit to their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, I heard ſay, You made vowes that if God bleſt You but that day with <note n="*" place="margin">Nazeby Fight.</note> Victory, you would not leave a Catholike in Your Army; for which I fear the Lord is ſo angry with You, that (I am afraid) he will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169830:20"/> not give you another day wherein you may ſo much as trie your fortune: Your Majeſty had forgot the monies which came unto you from unknown hands, and were brought unto you by unknown faces, when yau promiſed you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake your unknown friends; you have forgotten the miracalous bleſſings of the Almighty upon thoſe beginnings, and how have you diſcountenanc'd, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrusted, diſ-regarded, I, and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Catholiques all along, and at laſt vowed an extirpation of them: Doth not your Majesty ſee clearly, how that in the two great Battailes, the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Nazeby,</hi> God ſhewed ſignes of his diſpleaſure, when in the first, your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies were even at your mercy, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fell upon you and you loſt the day, like a man that ſhould ſo wound his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he could ſcarce ſtand, and afterwards his own ſword ſhould fly out of the hilt, and leave the strong and skilfull, to the mercy of his falling ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and in the ſecond (and I fear me
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169830:21"/> the laſt Battaile that e're you'le fight) whilst your men were crying victory, as I hear they had reaſon ſo to do, your ſword broke in the aire, which made you a fugitive to your flying enemies: Sir, I pray pardon my boldneſſe, for it is Gods cauſe that makes me ſo bold, and no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of my own to be ſo, and give me leave to tell you, that God is angry with you, and will never be pleaſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you have taken new reſolutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Religion: which I pray God direct you, or elſe you'le fall from nought to worſe, from thence to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                     <hi>by taking up our croſſe and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt; neither do I remember my Lord, that I made any ſuch vow before the Battaile of</hi> Nazeby <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Catholiques, but ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I did give my Proteſtant Subjects, who on the other ſide were perſwaded that God bleſt us the worſe for having ſo many Papiſts in our Army.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, if it be allowed to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, what the Catholick Church holds out for truth, becauſe that which they hold forth unto us ſeemes ridiculous, and to picke and chuſe verities accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own fancie, and reject as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties and forgeries what we pleaſe, as impoſſibilities and fabulous. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves may as well ſuffer by this kind of tolleration, for what more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169830:22"/> ridiculous then the Dialoge between <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> and his Aſs, or that <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrenght ſhould be in his hair, or that he ſhould ſlay a thouſand men with the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of an Aſs. The Diſputation betweeen Saint <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> about the body of <hi>Moſes; Philip's</hi> being taken up in the air, and found at <hi>Aroties</hi> with a thouſand the like ſtrange, and to our apprehenſion (if we look upon them with carnall eyes) vaine and ridiculous, but being they are recorded in Scripture, which Scripture we hold for truth, we admire, but never question them; ſo the fault may not be in the tradition of the Church, but in the libertie, which men aſſume to themſelves to question the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And I beſeech Your Majestie, to conſider the ſtreakes that are drawne over the Divine writ, as ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenda's by ſuch bold hands as thoſe: the Teſtaments were not like the two Tables, delivered into the hands of any <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the immediate hand of God, neither by the Miniſtration of Angels, but men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169830:23"/> inſpired with the holy Ghoſt writ, whoſe writings by the Church were approved to be by inſpiration, which inſpirations were called Scripture, which Scriptures moſt of them as they are now received into our hands, were not received into the Cannon of the Church, all, within three hundred years after Christ, why may not ſome bold ſpirits call all thoſe ſcriptures, (which were afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be Scripture, &amp; were not before) forgeries. Nay have not ſome ſuch (as blind as bold) done it already? Saint <hi>Hier</hi> was the firſt that ever pickt a hole in the Scriptures, and cut out ſo many books out of the word of God, with the penknife, of <hi>Apoccrypha, Ruffinus</hi> challengeth him for ſo doing, and tells him of the gap, that he hath opened for wild beaſts to enter into this field of the Church, and tread down all ill corn. <hi>Jerom</hi> gives his reaſons, becauſe they were not found in the Originall Copie, (as if the ſame ſpirit which gave to thoſe, whom it did inſpire the diverſities of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169830:23"/> tongues, ſhould it ſelf be tied to one language) but withall he acknowledgeth this much of thoſe books, which he had thus markt in the forehead, <hi>Canonici ſunt ad informandos mores, ſed non ad confirmandam fidem,</hi> how poor a Distinction this is, and how pernitious a preſident this was, I leave it to Your Majeſtie, to judge: for after him <hi>Luther</hi> takes the like boldneſs, and at once takes away the three Goſpels, of <hi>Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> Others take away the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> others the epiſtle of Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> others the ſecond and third epiſtles of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> others the epiſtle of Saint <hi>James,</hi> others the whole book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Wherefore to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, what the Church propoſes to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable by particular men, is to bring down the Church, the Scriptures, and the Heavens upon our heads; there was a Church, before there was a Scripture, which Scripture (as to us) had not been the Word of God, if the Church had not made it ſo by teaching us to believe it.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169830:24"/> The preaching of the Goſpel was before the writing of the Goſpell, the Divine Truth that diſperſed it ſelf over the face of the whole earth, before i'ts Divinitie was compriſed within the Cannon of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, was like that <hi>Primeva Lux,</hi> which the world received before the light was gathered into the body of the Sun, this body ſo glorious and comfortable is but the ſame light, which was before, we cannot make it an other, though it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and therefore though the Church and the Scripture, like the light that is concomitant and precedent to the Sun, be diſtinct in tearms, yet they are but one &amp; the ſame; no man can ſee the Sun, but by it's own light, ſhut your eyes from this light, and you cannot behold the body of the Sun. Shut your eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one, and you are blind in both, he never had God to be his Father, who had not the Church to be his Mother, if you admit Sillogiſmes, <hi>a priori,</hi> you will meet with many paralogiſmes, <hi>a poſteriori</hi> cry down the Churches, Authoritie, &amp; pull
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169830:24"/> out the Scriptures efficacie, give but the Church the lie, now and then, and you ſhall have enough will tell you the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is falſe here and there; they who have ſet ſo little by the tradition of the Church, have ſet by halfe the Scriptures, and will at last throw all away: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a word, as to denie any part of the Scripture, were to open a vain, ſo to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion any thing, which the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, is to teare the ſeamleſſe Coat of Christ, and to pierce his body.</p>

                  <p>Sir, it is no diſhonour for the Sun to make its progreſs from Eaſt to Weſt, it is ſtill the ſame Sun, and the difference is onely in the ſhadowes, which are made to differ according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of ſhapes, that the ſeverall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are of; East and West are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but the ſame day: neither can they be ſaid or imagined to be greater, or more extending one or other, and the one may have the benefit of the Suns light, though the other may have its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and I believe, no man of ſober judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can ſay, that any Church in the world is more generally ſpread over the face of the whole world, or that her glory ſhines in any place more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, then at this day in <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <hi>My Lord, If externall glory be the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, then the Church is there indeed; but if</hi>

                     <hi>internall ſanctity, &amp; inward holyneſs be the Eſſences of a Church, then we may be as much to ſeek for ſuch a Church within the Wals of</hi> Rome, <hi>as any where elſe.</hi>

                  <p>Who ſhall be Judge of that? I pray, obſerve the Injustice and Errours that will ariſe, if every man may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to be his own judge; you of the Church of <hi>England</hi> left your Mother the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Mother to all the Churches round about. You forſook her, and ſet up a new Church of your own, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent to her: there comes a new generation, and doth the like to you; and a third generation, that is likely to do the like to that; and the Church falls and falls, untill it falls to all the pieces of Independencie. It is a hard caſe for a part to fall away from the whole, and to be their own judges. Why ſhould not <hi>Kent</hi> fall away from <hi>England,</hi> and be their own judges, as well as <hi>England</hi> fall away from Chriſtendome, and be their own judges? why ſhould not a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169830:29"/> in <hi>Kent</hi> fall away from the whole County, and be their own judges? why ſhould not one Family fall away from the whole Pariſh, and be their own judges? why ſhould not one man fall away in his opinion from that Family, and be his own judge? If you grant one, you muſt grant all; and I fear me in doing one, you have done all. So that every man diſpiſeth the Church, whilst he is a Church to himſelf; rayles againſt Popery, and is the greatest Pope himſelf, diſpiſeth the Fathers, and will enthrone his own judgement above the wiſdome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; refuſeth Expoſitours, that he may have bis own ſence; and if he can ſtart up but ſome new opinions, he thinks himſelf as worthy a member of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as if he were an Apostle, to ſome new found land. Now Sir, though ſome do take the Church to be the Scriptures, yet the Scriptures cannot be the Church, becauſe the Scriptures ſend us to the Church, <hi>audi Eccleſiam, dic Eccleſiae,</hi> others take, the Elect to be the Church,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169830:30"/> yet this cannot be, for we know not who are elect, and who not, that which muſt be the Church, muſt be a viſible, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſocietie of men, to whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in caſes of appeale and matter of judgement, we are to acquieſſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. And I appeale to Your Royall heart, whether there be a Church in the world, to whom in theſe reſpects we ought to reverence, and eſteeme more then the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is externally glorious, it doth not follow, that therefore ſhe is not internall holy; for the Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters clothing was of wrought gold, as well as ſhe was all glorious within; and though ſhe had never ſo many Divine graces within her, yet ſhe had honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able women without her, as her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: and for the queſtion, whether this inward glory is to be ſo much ſought for within the gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: and not yet decided.</p>

                     <hi>My Lord, I have not done with you yet, though particular Churches may fall away in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall reſpects of obedience to one ſupreme Authority, yet it followes not, that the Church ſhould be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by divided, for as long as they agree in the unity of the ſame ſpirit, and the bond of peace, the Church, is ſtill at unitie, as ſo many ſheaves of corne are not unbound, becauſe they are ſevered. Many ſheaves may be long to one field, to one man, and may be carried to one barne, and be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the ſame table. Unity may conſiſt in this as wel as in being hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up together in a ricke with one cocke-ſheave above the reſt. I have a hundred pieces in my pocket,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:169830:32"/> 
                     <hi>I find them ſomething heavie, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſum, halfe in one pocket, and halfe in an other: and ſubdivide them afterwards in two ſeverall leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer pockets; The moneys is divided, but the ſum is not broke, the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds is as whole as when it was together, becauſe it belongs to the ſame man, and is in the ſame poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; ſo though we divide our ſelves from</hi> Rome, <hi>if neither of us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our ſelves from Chriſt, we agree in him, who is the Center of all unitie, though we differ in matter of depending upon one another. But my Lord of</hi> Worceſter, <hi>we are got into ſuch a large field of diſcourſe, that the greateſt Schollers of them all can ſooner ſhew us the way in, then out of it; therefore, before we go too far, let us retire, leſt we loſe our ſelves; and therefore, I pray my Lord, ſatisfie me in theſe particulars: Why do you leave out the ſecond Commandment, and cut another in</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:169830:32"/> 
                     <hi>too? why do you with-hould the Cup from the Laytie? why have you ſeven Sacraments, when Chriſt inſtituted but two? why do you abuſe the World with ſuch a fable, as Purgatory, and make ignorant fooles believe, you can fiſh ſoules from thence with ſilver hookes? why do you pray to Saints, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Images? Thoſe are the offences which are given by your Church of</hi> Rome <hi>unto the Church of Chriſt; of theſe things I would be ſatisfied.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, Although the Church be undefiled, yet ſhe may not be ſpotleſs, to ſeveral apprehenſions: for the Church is compared to the Moon, that is full of ſpots; but they are but ſpots of our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying; though the Church be never ſo cumly, yet ſhe is deſcribed unto us to have black eye-browes, which may to ſome be as great an occaſion of diſlike, as they are to others foyles, which ſet her off more lovely. We muſt not make our fancies, judgements of condemnation to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169830:33"/> her, with whom Chriſt ſo much was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed. For Your Majeſties Objections, and firſt, as to that of leaving out the ſecond Commandment, and cutting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in two; I beſeech Your Majeſties, who called them Commandments? who told you they were ten? who told you which were firſt, and ſecond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scripture onely called them <hi>words:</hi> thoſe words, but <hi>theſe:</hi> and theſe words were never divided in the Scriptures into ten Commandments, but two Tables. The Church did all this, and might as well have named them twenty as ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; that which Your Majeſtie calls the ſecond Commandment, is but the explanation of the firſt, and is not razed out of the Bible, but for brevitie ſake in the mannualls it is left out, as the rest of the Commandment is left out concerning the Sabbath, and others: wherefore the ſame Church which gave them their Name, their Number, and their Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, may in their breviats, leave out what ſhe deems to be but expoſition: and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169830:33"/> deliver what ſhe thinks for ſubstance, without any ſuch heavie charge as being blottable, out of the book of life, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the word of God.</p>
                  <p>For withholding the Cup from the Laytie; where did Christ, either give or command to be given, either the bread or the wine to any ſuch? <hi>drink you all of this:</hi> but they were all Apoſtles to whom he ſaid ſo; There were neither lay men, or women, there: If the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them afterwards to receive it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one, or both kinds: they ought to be ſatisfied therewith, accordingly: but not queſtion the Churches her Actions. She that could alter the <hi>Sabbath</hi> into the Lords day, and change the dipping of the baptiſed over head and eares in water, to a little ſprinkling upon the face, (by reaſon of ſome immergencies, &amp; inconveniencies, occaſioned by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Seaſons, and Countryes) may upon the like occaſion, accordingly, diſpoſe of the manner of her Adminiſtration of her Sacraments. Neither was this done
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169830:34"/> without great reaſon the world had not wine in all her Countries, but it had bread. Wherefore it was thought for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity ſake (that they might not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to one another, but all receive alike, that they ſhould onely receive the bread, which was to be had in every place, and not the Cup, in regard, that wine was not every where to be had. I wonder that any body ſhould be ſo much offended at any ſuch thing, for bread and wine do ſignifie Chriſt crucified; I appeale to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, if a dead body doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a paſſion, as nuch, as if we ſaw the bloud lie by it. If you grant the Churches Power in other matters, and reſt ſatisfie therein, why do you boggle at this? eſpecially, when any Prieſt (where wine is to be had) if you deſire it, he will give it you. But if upon every mans call, the Church ſhould fall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming upon every ſeeming fault, which may be but ſuppoſed to be found, the people would never ſtop, untill they had made ſuch a through Reformation in all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169830:34"/> parts, as they have done in the greatest part of <hi>Germany,</hi> where there is not a man to preach, or hear the Goſpel, to eat the bread, or drink the wine: you never pickt ſo mony holes in our Coates, as this licentiouſneſs hath done in yours.</p>
                  <p>For our ſeven Sacraments, ſhe that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Articles of our <hi>Faith</hi> 12, the <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi> 8, the <hi>Graces</hi> 3, the <hi>Virtues</hi> 4, called theſe 7, &amp; might have called them 17, if ſhe had thought it meet. A Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is nothing elſe but what is done with a holy mind, and why Sacrament either in Name, or Number, ſhould be confind to Chriſts onely Institution, I ſee no cauſe for it; If I can prove that God did insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſuch a thing in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> (as he did marriage) ſhall not I call that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as what was inſtituted by Christ, when he was upon the Earth? If Chriſt inſtitutes the Order of giving &amp; receiving the holy Ghost, ſhall not I call this the Sacrament of Orders? If Chriſt injoyns us all repentance, ſhall we not ſay repentance is a Sacrament? If Chriſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169830:35"/> bleſſeth little children, and ſaith, <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to come unto me and forbid them not;</hi> ſhall we not ſay, that ſuch Confirmation is a Sacrament? Truly I do not underſtand their meaning; They have taken away five, which five, either by God or Christ, or the holy Ghoſt (who are all one) were inſtituted; and yet they ſay, they are not Sacraments, becauſe they were not inſtituted by Christ: And the two that are left <hi>viz.</hi> baptiſme and the Lords Supper; for the firſt, you hold it neceſſary to Salvation; and for the ſecond, you do not admit the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: ſo that of the two remaining, you have taken away the neceſſitie of the one, and the reality of the other, ſo fare well all.</p>
                  <p>Now for Purgatory, I do believe, we have as good ground for it out of this place of Scripture, <hi>viz. He ſhall be purged, yet ſo as if it were by fire:</hi> as you can prove a Hell out of this place of Scripture: <hi>He ſhall be caſt into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs, and into the lake that</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:169830:35"/> 
                     <hi>burneth with fire and brimſtone, where ſhall be weeping and knatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</hi> Neither can you make more exceptions to our inference out of this place of Scripture, to prove Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, then the Atheist (if wits may be permitted to roame in ſuch things, as theſe once ſetled (and believed general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) will find ground enough to quarrell at your burning lake; and the vaine Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, Contradictions enough, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, of the effects of thoſe helliſh Torments, <hi>viz.</hi> weeping and knaſhing of teeth: the one having its procedure from heat, the other from cold, which are meer Contradictions, and therefore fabulous; take heed, we do not take away Hell, in removing of Purgatory. You ſee not, how your laughing at Purgatory hath cauſed ſuch laughing at Hell, and Devils; untill at laſt, you ſhall ſee them bid the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens come down; and plucke the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie out of his Throne; If a Text of Scripture with the Churches Expoſition be not ſufficient for a man to rest, both
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169830:36"/> his Science &amp; Conſcience upon: I know not where it will find a reſting place, it may ſhoot at Random, but never take ſo right an ayme; and for the ſilver hooke you talk'd of, I do not juſtifie the abuſe of any, I know there is a great difference between the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and if theſe Errours were in the Church it ſelf, yet the tares muſt not be haſtily pluckt out of the field of the Church, leaſt the wheat be pluckt up with it.</p>
                  <p>Now for our praying to Saints, there is no body that prayes to any Saints, otherwiſe then as we on earth deſire the benefit of one anothers prayers. We do not believe, that they can help us (of themſelves) or that they have power to forgive ſin, but we believe that they are nearer to God, his favour &amp; more dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and therefore we believe, that he will hear them with, or for us, ſooner then he will hear us when we pray upon our own account: as we deſire the prayers of ſome good and holy man, (whom we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169830:36"/> believe to be ſo) hoping it will be a benefit unto us; all that can be ſaid againſt it, is, that they do not hear us. I will not trouble Your Majeſtie with the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens <hi>Speculum Creatoris,</hi> but I ſhall deſire to be plaine, when there is <hi>joy in heaven over every ſinner that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:</hi> do you think that the Saints which are there, are ignorant of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that joy? or do they rejoyce at they know not what? If the Saints in heaven do crie, how long Lord, how long holy and juſt, doſt thou not avenge our bloud upon them, which dwell upon the earth: if they know that their bloud is not yet avenged, do they not know when a ſinner is converted? and if they know the time of converſion, do they not know the time of prayer? If <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that there were ſuch men as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets, who was dead ſo many hundreds of years before their time, can we ſay, that they are ignorant? think ye, that thoſe miniſtring Angels who are called Intelligencers, give them no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169830:37"/> intelligences? or that they gather no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of intelligence by looking him in the face, who is the fullneſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to all theſe the practiſe and opinion of ſo Catholick a Church; God can onely forgive ſins, Christ can onely mediat, but Saints, whether in heaven, or on the earth, may intercede for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for our worſhipping of Images: confounded be all they that worſhipped them, for me, God is onely worthy to be worſhipped; but if I kneel before the Picture of my <hi>Saviour,</hi> I worſhip him kneeling before his Picture; the worſhip is in the heart, and not in the knee, and where the true God is in the intention, there can be no idolatrie.</p>
                  <p>O Sir, Chriſtian Religion is not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, but a Goſpel: it would better conſist with unity, then oppoſition: we hold it a peece of popery to knocke our own breaſts with the fiſts of conſtitution, whilſt we hold it most Evangelicall, to knocke at our neighbours with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169830:37"/> ſtaff: a pious care in a mother Church, labours to educate her own daughter, and having fed her at her own breaſts, all the gratitude ſhe returns her mother, is to call her whore, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, Babylon, and all the ſpitefull and vile names that can be imagined, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that ſaying of the Apoſtle St. <hi>James: If any man among you ſeeme to be religious, &amp; bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that mans Religion is in vaine; Pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and undefiled before God, and the Father, is this: to viſit the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and widows, in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to keep himſelf unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the world.</hi> What ſhould I ſay more, the Scriptures are made a noſe of wax, for every bold hand to wring it which way he pleaſeth, they are rejected by private men, by whole books, The Articles of our Creed are ſaid not to be of the Apostle framing, the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not belonging to Chriſtians, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be kept, the Sacraments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169830:38"/> Charity not onely grown cold, but quite ſtarved, and they will be ſav'd by meanes, quite contrary to what the Goſpel (which they ſeeme to profeſs) ſets down, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith without good works, onely believe &amp; thats enough, where as the holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> tells us, that faith profiteth nothing without good works—</p>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:169830:39"/> 
                     <hi>I am ſo far from thinking that either Faith, without good works, or that good works, without Faith, can juſtifie: that I cannot Believe that there is ſuch a thing as either. No more then I can imagine, that there may be a tree bearing fruit, without a root: or that the Sun can be up, before it be day: or that a fire can have no heat; for although it be poſſible, that a man may do ſome good without Faith, yet he cannot do good works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; for though we may naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to ſome goodneſſe, as flowers and plants naturally grow to perfection; Yet this good cannot be ſaid to be wrought by us, but by the hand of Faith; and Faith her ſelf (where ſhe is truly ſo) can no more ſtand ſtill, then can the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or refuſe to let her hight ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee her good works, then the ſame Sun can appear in the ſame Firmament, and dart no beams. And whilſt Faith and good works ſtrive for the proprietie of Juſtification; I do believe, they both exclude a third, which hath more right to our Juſtification then either. For that which we call Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith, is not properly Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but onely an apprehenſion of it: as</hi>

                     <hi>May it pleaſe Your Majeſtie: A great many Controverſies between us and the Papiſts might be ſoon decided, if the Churches revennues (which were every where taken away, more or leſs, where differences in Religion, in ſeveral parts of the world, did ariſe in the Church) were not an obſtacle of the reunion; like the ſtone, which the Crab caſt into the Oyſter, which hindred it from ever ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelf again; like the diviſion, which happened between the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Photinus <hi>intrudes himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Patriarch-ſhip of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>over the head of</hi> Ignatius, <hi>the lawfull Patriarch thereof, whom the Pope preſerved in his Communion, and then the difference of the Proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Churches, was fomented by the ſayd</hi> Photinus: <hi>leaſt the wound</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:169830:41"/> 
                     <hi>ſhould heale to ſoone, and the patient ſhould not be held long enough in cure, for the benefit of the</hi> Chyrurgion, <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath brought more diviſions then the nature of their cauſes have required: and the univerſities play with edged tools, whilſt hungry ſtomacks run away with their meat; wherefore ſince Your Majeſtie was pleaſed to diſcharge the watch, that I had ſet before the door of my lips: I ſhall make bold to put Your Majeſtie in mind of houlding my Lord to the demand which Your Majeſtie once made unto his Lordſhip concerning the true Church; for if once that Queſtion were througly determined, all Controverſies not onely between Your Majeſtie &amp; his Lordſhip, but alſo all the Controverſies that ever were ſtarted, would ſoon be decided at a ſhort race end, and without this, we take away the meanes of reconciliation. For I muſt confeſſe ingeniouſly (yet under the higheſt correction) that there is not a thing that I ever underſtood leſs, then that aſſertion of the Scriptures being judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, though in ſome ſence I muſt, and will acknowledge it: but not as it is a book conſiſting of papers, words, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for as we commonly ſay in matters</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:169830:42"/> 
                     <hi>of civil differences, the Law ſhall be the Judge between us: we do not mean, that every man ſhall run unto the Law books, or that any Lawyer himſelf ſhall ſearch his Law-caſes, and thereupon poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of any thing that is in queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and another, without a legall trial and determination by lawfull Judges, conſtituted to that ſame purpoſe; In like manner ſaving knowledge and Divine Truths are the portion, that all Gods children layes faſt claime unto: yet they muſt not be their own carvers, though it is their own meat, that is before them, whilſt they have a mother at the table; They muſt not ſlight all Orders, Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, Appeales and Rules of Faith! Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge and Divine Truths, are not to be wreſted from the Scripture by private hands, for then the Scripture were of private interpretation: which is againſt the Apoſtles Rule! neither are thoſe undefiled incorruptible and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate inheritances, which are reſerved for us in heaven, to be conveighed unto us by any Privy-ſeales. For there is nothing more abſurd, to my underſtanding, then to ſay, that the thing conteſted (which is the true meaning of the Scriptures) ſhall</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:169830:42"/> 
                     <hi>be Judge of the Conteſtation: no way inferiour to that abſurditie, which would follow, would be this, if we ſhould leave the deciding of the ſence of the words of the Law, to the preoccupated underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one of the Advocates; neither is this all the abſurditie that doth ariſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Suppoſition: for if you grant this to one, you muſt grant it to any one, and to every one: if there were but two, how will you reconcile them both? If you grant that this judicature muſt be in many, there are many manyes, which of the manyes will you have? decide but that, and you ſatisfie all. For if you make the Scripture the Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, you make the reader Judge of the Scripture: as a man conſiſts of a ſoul and body, ſo the Scripture conſiſts of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the ſence, if I make the dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Judge, I am the greateſt, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt idolater in the world: it will tell me no more, then it told the</hi> Indian <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> Powhaton, <hi>who asking the Jeſuite, how he knew all that to be true which he had told him, and the Jeſuite anſwering him, that Gods word did tell him ſo.

                     <hi>Doctor, Saint</hi> John <hi>in his firſt Epiſtle tells us, that the holy Scripture is that, to whoſe truth the Spirit beareth witneſs.

                     <hi>become childrens bread. All that Your Majeſtie hath ſaid concerning the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſufficiencie, is true, provided, that thoſe Scriptures be duly handled, for as the Law is ſufficient to determine, right and keep all in peace and quiteneſs, yet the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that ſufficiencie, cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without Courts and Judges: ſo when we have granted the Scriptures to be all that the moſt reverend eſtimation can attribute unto them, yet Religion cannot be exerciſed, nor differences in Religion reconciled, without a Judge; For as Saint</hi> Jerom <hi>tells us, who was no great friend to Popes or Biſhops:</hi> Si non una, exors quaedam, &amp; iminens detur poteſtas tot efficerentur in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia ſchiſmata quot Sacerdotes. <hi>Wherefore I would faine find out that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture bids me hear,</hi> audi Eccleſiam: <hi>I would faine referre my ſelf to that to which the Scripture commands me to appeale, and tells me, that if I do not, I ſhall be a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and a Publican,</hi> dic Eccleſiae: <hi>which Church Saint</hi> Paul <hi>in his firſt Epiſtle calls the pillar and foundation of Truth, of which the Propbet</hi> Ezekiel <hi>ſaith:</hi> I will place my Sanctification in the midſt of her for ever: <hi>and the Prophet</hi> Eſay, <hi>that the Lord would never forſake her, in whoſe light</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:169830:44"/> 
                     <hi>the people ſhall walke, and Kings in the brightneſs of her Orient; Againſt which our</hi> Saviour <hi>ſaith:</hi> The gates of Hell ſhall not pervaile: <hi>with whom our</hi> Saviour <hi>ſaith:</hi> he would be alwayes unto the end of the world. <hi>And from whom the Spirit of Truth ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart. For although the</hi> Pſalmiſt <hi>tells us, that the word of the Lord is clear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the eyes, yet the ſame Prophet ſaid to God:</hi> Enlighten mine eyes, that I may ſee the marveils of thy Law: <hi>And Saint</hi> John <hi>tells us, that the book of God had ſeven Seales, and it was not every one that was thought worthy to open it, onely the lambe. The Diſciples had been ignorant, if</hi> Jeſus <hi>had not opened the Scriptures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The</hi> Eunuch <hi>could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them without an Interpreter; and Saint</hi> Peter <hi>tels us, that the Scripture is not of private Interpretation: and that in his brother</hi> Pauls <hi>epiſtles there are many things hard to be underſtood, which ignorant and light-headed-men wreſt, to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Wherefore though as Saint</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom <hi>ſaith:</hi> Omnia clara ſunt &amp; plana ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturis divinis: quaecunque neceſſaria ſunt, manifeſta ſunt: <hi>yet no man ever hath yet defined what are neceſſary, and what not. What points are fundamentall, and what</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:169830:45"/> 
                     <hi>are not fundamentall. Neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is one thing, and neceſſary for knowledge as an improvement of our faith is an other thing, for the firſt, if a man keeps the Commandments, and believes all the Articles of the Creed, he may be ſaved, though he never read a word of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but much more aſſuredly if he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates upon Gods word with the</hi> Pſalmiſt <hi>day and night. But if he meanes to walk by the rule of Gods word, and to ſearch the Scriptures, he muſt lay hold upon the means that God hath ordained, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may attain unto the true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them; for as Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith:</hi> God hath placed in the Church Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Doctors, <hi>to the end we ſhould be no more little children, blowen about with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, therefore it is not for babes in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to take upon them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe things, wherein ſo great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as the Prophet</hi> David <hi>confeſſed the darkneſs of his own ignorance. And though it be true, the Scripture is a river through which a lambe may wade, and an Elephant may ſwim, yet it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and underſtood, that the lambe muſt wade but onely through, where the</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:169830:45"/> 
                     <hi>river is foordable; It doth not ſuppoſe the river to be all alike in depth, for ſuch a river was never heard of; but there may be places in the river, where the lambe may ſwim as well as the Elephant, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is impoſſible that an Elephant ſhould ſwim in the ſame depth, where a lambe may wade, though in the ſame ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he may; neither is it the meaning of that place, that the child of God may wade through the Scripture without directions, help, or Judges, but that the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, qualified with a harmeleſs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and deſirous to wade through that river of living waters to eternal life, may find ſo much of Comfort, and heavenly knowledge there eaſily to be obtained, that he may eaſily wade through to his eternal Salvation; and that there are alſo places in the ſame river, wherein the higheſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations may plunge themſelves, in the deep miſteries of God. Wherefore with pardon crav'd for my preſumption, in holding Your Majeſtie in ſo tedious a diſcourſe, as alſo, for my boldneſs in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding my opinion, which is except (as incomparable</hi> Hooker <hi>in his Eccleſiaſticall pollicy hath well obſerved) the Churches Authority be required herein, as neceſſary</hi>

                     <hi>hereunto we ſhall be ſo far from agreeing upon the true meaning of the Scripture, that the outward letter ſealed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward witneſs of the Spirit (being all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks have quoted Scripture and pretended Spirit) will not be a warrant ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for any private man, to judge ſo much as the Scripture to be Scripture: or the Goſpel it ſelf, to be the Goſpel of Chriſt: This Church being found out, and her Authority allowed of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies would be ſoon decided, and although we allow the Scripture to be the lock, upon the door, which is Chriſt, yet we muſt allow the Church, to be the Key, that muſt open it; as Saint</hi> Ambroſe <hi>in his 38. Sermon calls the agreement of the Apoſtles in the Articles of our beliefe,</hi> Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Scripturae, <hi>one of whoſe Articles is, I believe the holy Catholick Church. As the Lion, wants neither ſtrength, nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, nor power, nor weapons, to ſeize upon his prey, yet he wants a noſe to find it out: wherefore by naturall inſtinct, he takes to his aſſiſtants, the little Jack-call: a quick ſented beaſt: who runs before the Lion, and having found out the prey in his language, gives the Lion notice of it, who ſoberly untill ſuch time as he fixes his</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſt crucified is the main ſubſtance of the Goſpel, according to the Apoſtles ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> I deſire to know nothing, but Jeſus, and him crucified; <hi>This crucified Chriſt is the nouriſhment of our ſoules, according to our</hi> Saviours <hi>own words:</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Cadaver, ibi aquilae. <hi>Thereby drawing his Diſciples from the curious ſpeculation of his body glorified, to the profitable meditation of his body crucified: It is the prey of the Elect: the dead Carkes feedeth the Eagles, Chriſt crucified, nouriſheth his Saints: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Saint</hi> Johns <hi>ſaying,</hi> except we eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his bloud, we have no life in us; <hi>him we muſt maſtigate, and chew by faith: traject, and convey him into our hearts as nutriment, by meditation: and digeſt him by Coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we grow one with Chriſt, and Chriſt becomes one with us, according to that ſaying of</hi> Tertullian, auditu devoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus eſt, intellectu ruminandus, fide digerendus.</p>

               <p>Sir, I have not a thought in my heart, that tends not to the ſervice of my God, and you: and if I could have reſisted this motion of his Spirit, I had deſiſted long ago, but I could not: wherefore on both my knees, I pray to his Divine Majeſtie, that he will not be wanting to his own Ordinance, but will direct Your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to thoſe things, which ſhall make You a happy King upon Earth, and a Saint in Heaven; And thereupon he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169830:50"/> fell a weeping, bidding me to light His Majeſtie to His Chamber.

                  <p>IT must be granted by all: that there must be (alwayes) in the world, one, holy, Catholick, and Apoſtolique Church: one, that it may be uniforme: holy, that it may be certain: Catholick, that it may be known: and Apoſtolick, that it may ſucceed: this Church muſt be either the <hi>Romane,</hi> or the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or elſe, ſome other, that is oppoſite to both. It cannot be any Church which is oppoſite to both: becauſe, the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not (when ſhe ſeparated from the <hi>Romane)</hi> joyn her ſelf to any: not to the <hi>Grecian:</hi> for that houlds as many Doctrines contrary to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as doth the <hi>Romane;</hi> nor to any elſe, becauſe, ſhe agrees with none, no reformed Church under the Sun, that is,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169830:51"/> or ever was, hath the ſame articles of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, as hath the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and from any other Church, beſides the <hi>Romane,</hi> ſhe never had a being: and with any other Church beſides the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> ſhe never had Communion; She cannot be that one, becauſe ſhe is but one: nor Catholick, becauſe ſhe agrees not with any: nor Apoſtolick, becauſe ſhe hath acknowledged ſuch a fine and recovery, that has quite cut off the entaile which would have (otherwiſe) deſcended unto her from the Apoſtles; neither can ſhe be holy, becauſe ſhe is none of all the other three. Now if theſe Attributes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong unto the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and do (clearly) belong unto the <hi>Roman,</hi> then is the Church of <hi>Rom,</hi> the Catholick Church. And that it doth, I ſhall prove it by the marks, which God Almighty hath given us, whereby we ſhould know her.</p>

Now I confeſſe, that this glory is belonging to all Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion: yet amongst all thoſe, who do profeſs the name of Chriſt, I believe, Your Majeſtie will conſent with me herein, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, hath this forme of univerſality, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above all different and diſtinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion, but alſo beyond all Religions of the world, Turkes or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: and that there is no place in the world, where there are not <hi>Romane</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; which is manifestly wanting to all other Religions, whatſoever: Now I hope Your Majestie cannot ſay ſo of any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion: neither that Your Majeſtie will call all thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> but not <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Catholicks, or Catholicks of the

                     <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, being they are not religated within the ſame Communion, and fellowſhips: for then Religion would conſist in proteſtation rather then unity; in Nations falling off from one another, rather then all nations flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one another: neither is it a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration altogether invalid, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath kept poſſeſſion of the name; all along other reformed Churhes, leaving her in poſſeſſion of the name, and taking unto themſelves new names according to their ſeverall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: except the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (who is now herſelf become like a Chapter that is full of nothing elſe) whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was ſuch a one, whoſe name it may be they were unwilling to own.</p>
                  <p>For antiquitie, if we ſhould <hi>inquire after the old paths, which is the good way, and walk therein;</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> adviſeth us: if we ſhould take our Saviours rule, <hi>Ab initio au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, non fuit ſic:</hi> if we ſhould obſerve his ſaying, how the <hi>good ſeed</hi> was firſt

And I could not find any Church in the world, to whom that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy of <hi>Eſay</hi> might more fitly appertain, then to the Church of <hi>Rome: I have ſet</hi>

                  <p>It is not enough to ſay, I maintaine the ſame Faith and Religion which the Apostles taught, and therefore, I am of the true Church, ancient, and viſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: becauſe (as I have ſaid before) every heretick will ſay as much: but if you cannot by theſe markes of the Church, (ſet down in Scripture) clear your ſelves to be the true Church, you vainly appeal to the Scriptures ſiding with you in any particular point: for what can be more obſurd, then to appeale from Scripture (ſetting things down clearly) unto Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſetting down things more obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely? There is no particular point of Doctrine in the holy Scripture ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſet down, as that concerning the Church, and the Markes thereof: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſet down more copious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous then the viſibility, perpetuitie and amplitude of the Church.</p>

                  <p> So that Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did not ſtick to ſay, that the Scriptures were more clear about the Church, then they were about Christ. Let him anſwer for it. He ſaid ſo in his book, <hi>de unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> and this (he ſaid) was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: becauſe, God (in his wiſedome) would have the Church to be deſcribed without any ambiguity, that all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about the Church may be clearly decided: wherehy questions about par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrines, may find determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in her judgement: and that Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility might ſhew the way unto the moſt rude and ignorant: and I know not any Church, to whom it may more just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be attributed, then to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> whoſe Faith (as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was ſpread through the whole world) ſo (all along) and at this day, it is generally known among all nations. Next to this, I prove the Catholick Church to be the <hi>Romane;</hi> becauſe, a lawfull ſucceſſion of Paſtors is required in every true Church, according to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169830:55"/> Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> his Prophecie concerning her, <hi>viz. My Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, for ever;</hi> This ſucceſſion I can find onely in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> This Succeſſion they onely can prove; none elſe, offering to go about it. This Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſayes, kept him in that Church, <hi>viz.</hi> a Succeſſion of Prieſts, from the very ſeat of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, to the preſent Biſhop of his time. And <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons all the <hi>Romane</hi> Biſhops, from Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Syricius,</hi> who then was Pope: and by this, he ſhewed and made it his Argument, that the true Church was not with the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> bidding them, to ſhew the Originall of their Chayre: this no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> did, or ever can do: The <hi>Romane</hi> Church gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Commiſſion to preach the Doctrine
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169830:55"/> of Chriſt, as they have delivered it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: but they never gave them any Commiſſion to preach against her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which Biſhops being turned out, for obſerving the <hi>depoſitum</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were inſtructed) and new Biſhops choſen in their room (by her, who not contenting her ſelf with being a nurſing mother thereof, muſt needs be head of the child: and moderatrix in the ſame Church, wherein by the Apoſtles precept ſhe is forbidden to ſpeak) the Succeſſion was broke off: the branch cut off from the body, becoming no part of the tree, ſit for nothing but to be chopt into ſmaller pieces, and ſo fitted for the fire; this proofe of Succeſſion the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> thought ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for proving their Church to be the true Church, that they affirmed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be conſecrated by Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, their Predeceſſors, wbich (never proved) argues the interruption, and affirming it, ſhewes how that (in their own opinion) the Succeſſion could not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169830:56"/> hold in the inferiour Miniſters (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it cannot) for as there is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſupply of Embaſſadours in all places, yet the Succeſſion is in the royall race: ſo though all vacancies are reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by Miniſters of the Goſpel, yet the Succeſſion of the Authority was in the Biſhops, as deſcended (to them) from the Apostles, according to our Saviours rule: <hi>I will be with you alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world;</hi> Which Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of theirs, argues that their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is inſufficient without it: and in that they would faine derive it from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it argues, that that is the true Church: and yet they would forſake her, ſuppoſing her to have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, when that Reformation it ſelf, was but a Suppoſition; for ſeeing they hold that their Church may erre, they can be certain of nothing: and whilſt (for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſake) they forſake the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> (in forſaking her) may be in the greatest er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of all: where there is neither Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169830:56"/> nor aſſurance, I muſt leave her to her ſelf, and Your Majeſtie to judge.</p>
                  <p>Next: I prove, the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, to be the true Church, by her unity in Doctrine: for ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all the Churches children to be <hi>of one mind.</hi> viz. <hi>I beſeech you, that all ſpeak one thing; Be ye knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one mind, and one Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 3. <hi>The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them that believed, were of one heart, &amp; of one ſoul,</hi> Act. 4. 32. <hi>Continue in one ſpirit and one mind, of one accord and one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Phil. 1. 27. Phil. 2. 2. So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour prayeth that <hi>they may be one;</hi> So Joſeph forewarned his brethren, that <hi>they ſhould not fall out by the way,</hi> knowing that whilst they were with him, he could order them: when they came to their father, he could order them: but having no head, they ſhould be apt to diſſentious. This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity I find no where
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169830:57"/> but in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> agreeing in all things, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath determined for Doctrine, whereas the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine, like the hereſie of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> divided it ſelf into ſeverall Sects, and to that of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> which were cut into ſmall threds, in ſo much, that among the many Religions which are lately ſprung up, and the ſub, ſub, ſubdiviſions under them: each one (pretending to be the true <hi>Proteſtant)</hi> excluding the other: and all of them together, no more likely to be bound up in the bond of peace, then a bundle of thornes, can expect binding with a rope of ſand; In vaine is their excuſe, if non-diſagreement in fundamentalls: for they diſ-agree amongſt themſelves about the Sacrament: for the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> hold Conſubſtantiation: but the Church of <hi>England</hi> no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>Some, that Christ deſcended into hell: others not. The Church of <hi>England</hi> maintaine their King to be the head of the Church: The <hi>Helvetians</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

But the <hi>Romane</hi> Church I find ſtretching forth her armes, from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> receiving and imbracing all within her Communion; For the firſt three hundred years, the Church grew down-ward, like a ſtrong building,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169830:60"/> whoſe foundations are first laid in the earth, whoſe ſtones are knit together in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity by the morter that was tempered with the bloud of her ten Perſecutions. Afterwards this building, hasting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Conſtantine the great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ſubmitting his neck unto the yoke of Chriſt, ſubdued all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches to Pope Sylveſter, then Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>from which time to theſe our dayes the Pope and his Clergie hath poſſeſſed the outward and viſible Church,</hi> as is confeſſed by <hi>Napier,</hi> a learned <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in his treatiſe upon the <hi>Revelation</hi> pag. 145. and all along hath added Kingdoms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kingdoms to her Communion: untill ſhe had incorporated into her ſelf, not onely <hi>Europe,</hi> but <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America:</hi> as <hi>Simon Lythus,</hi> a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant writer, affirmeth, <hi>viz.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169830:60"/> read <hi>Joan. Petrus Maffeus Hiſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicarum, Joſ. Acoſta de natur. novi orbis:</hi> You ſhall find that no Church in the world hath ever ſpread ſo farre and wide, as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope in this reſpect (alſo) I may ſafely conclude that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> most justly deſerves to be called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it a vainer thing, to ſay, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be head of the Church, becauſe Chriſt himſelf is head thereof; then it is for a man to ſay, that the King of <hi>England</hi> cannot be King of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe, <hi>God is King of all the earth,</hi> Pſal. 46. 8. As if the King could not be Gods Vice-gerent, and the peoples viſible God? ſo the Pope Chriſts Vicar or Deputy, &amp; the Churches viſible head. And let Kings beware, how they give way to ſuch Arguments as theſe, leaſt at the laſt, ſuch inferences be made upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>As ſtrange an inference is that, how that the Church was not built upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:169830:61"/> becauſe it was built upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as if it might not be built cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually upon the one, and formally upon the other: as if both theſe could not ſtand together: as if the Confeſſion of <hi>Peters</hi> Faith might not be the cauſe, why Christ built his Church upon his Perſon; as if Chriſt did not as well (perſonally) tell him, <hi>Tu es Petrus:</hi> as (ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>ſuper hanc Petram (id eſt ſuper iſtam Confeſſionem) aedificabo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>YOur Majeſtie is pleaſed to wave all the marks of the true Church; and to make recourſe unto the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>I humbly take leave to ask Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie what heretique that ever was did not do ſo? How ſhall the greateſt heretique in the world, be confuted or cenſured; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man may be permitted to appeal to Scriptures: margind with his own notes, ſenc'd with his own meaning, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened with his own private ſpirit: to what end were thoſe marks ſo fully, both by the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and our Saviour himſelf ſet down, if we make no uſe of them? To what uſe are land marks ſet up, if Marriners will not believe them to be ſuch?</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding after that I have ſaid, what I have to ſay in removall of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169830:68"/> certain obſtacles that lie in the way, I ſhall lead your Majeſty to my Church, through the full body of the Scriptures, or not at all, and then I ſhall leave it to your royall heart to judge (when you ſhall ſee that we have Scripture on our ſide) whether or no the interpretation thereof be likelier to be true, that hath been adjudged ſo by Councels, renowned Fathers, famous for ſanstity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life; continued for the ſpace of a thouſand or twelve hundred years, by your own confeſſion, univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; or that ſuch a one as <hi>Luther</hi> (his word ſhall be taken, either without Scripture, or againſt it, with <hi>ſic volo,</hi> and <hi>ſic Jubeo;</hi> a man who confeſſed himſelf, that he received his doctrine from the Devil; or ſuch a one as <hi>Calvin</hi> and their aſſociates, notoriouſly infamous in their lives &amp; converſations, plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to their Moſes and Aaron, united to the ſame perſon ſhould counter-ballance al the worthies, deterninations of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, &amp; the continued practices which ſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169830:69"/> many ages produced.</p>
                  <p>If your Majeſty means by the Church all the profeſſors of the Goſpel; all that are Christians are ſo the true Church; then we are ſo in your own ſenſe, and you in ours: then none who believe in the bleſſed Trinity, the articles of the Creed; none, who deny the Scriptures to be the word of God, let them conſture them as they pleaſe, can be hereticall, or of a wrong Religion; therefore we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguiſh them thus: and by the Protestant Church and Religion, we muſt understand thoſe opinions which the Proteſtants hold contrary to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and by the <hi>Romane,</hi> the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which they hold diſſenting from the <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> and then we will ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have Scripture for our religion or not: and whether you have Scripture for what you maintain: and whoſe opinions are moſt approved of by the Primitive times, &amp; Fathers; and what ground your late Divines have built their new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon; and then I ſhall give your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169830:69"/> an anſwer to the objection which you make againſt our Church: viz. <hi>That ſhe hath forſaken her firſt love, and fallen from the principles which ſhe held, when ſhe converted us to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But first to the removall of thoſe rubs in our way; and then I ſhall ſhew as much reverence to the Scripture as any <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> in the world; and ſhall endeavour to ſhew your Majesty that the Sctiptures are the Baſis or foundation upon which our Church is built.</p>
                  <p>Your Majeſty was pleaſed to urge the errors of certain Fathers, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their authority; which I conceive would have been ſo, had they been all <hi>Montaniſts, Rebaptiſts, all Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphiſts,</hi> and all of them generally guilty of the faults, where-with they were ſeverally charged, in the particulars: ſeeing that when we produce a Father, we doe not intend to produce a man in whoſe mouth was never found guile: the infallibility being never artributed, by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169830:70"/> us, otherwiſe then unto the Church, not unto particular Church-men: as Your Majesty hath moſt excellenly obſerved, in the failings of the holy Apostles, who erred after they had received the holy Ghoſt, in ſo ample manner: but when they were all gathered together in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and could ſend about their <hi>edicts,</hi> with theſe capitall letters in the front, <hi>Viſum eſt ſpiritui ſancto &amp; nobis:</hi> Acts 15. 28. then I hope your Majeſty cannot ſay, that it was poſſible for them to erre.</p>
                  <p>So, though the Fathers might, erre in particulars; yet thoſe particular errors would be ſwallowed up in a generall Councel, and be no more conſiderable in reſpect of the whole, then ſo many heat-drops of error, can ſtand in competition with a cloud of witneſſes, to the divine truth; &amp; be no more prejudiciall to their general determinations, then ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, are prejudicial to a general rule. Neither is a particular defection in any man any exception againſt his testimony,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169830:70"/> cept it be in the thing wherhin he is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; for otherwiſe we ſhould be of the nature of the flies, who only prey upon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, leaving all the rest of the body that is whole unregarded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Your Majeſty taxes generall Councels for committing errors. If Your Majeſty would be pleaſed to ſearch into the times wherein thoſe Councels were called, Your Majeſty ſhall find, that the Church was then under perſecution, and how that <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperours, rather made Aſſemblies of Divines, then called any generall Councels; and if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be generall and free Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, yet they could not be erroneous in any particular mans judgement, untill a like generall Councel ſhould have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the former to be erroneous; (except you wil allow particulars to condemn ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, &amp; private men the whol Church) all generall Councels, from the firſt unto the laſt that ever were, or ſhall be, maks but one Church: and though in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervails, there be no ſeſſion of perſons,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169830:71"/> yet there is perpetuall virtue in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, to which every man ought to appeal for judgment, in point of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. Now as it is a maxim in our law, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit regi:</hi> ſo it is a maxim in divinity, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit deo: Vbi deus eſt,</hi> as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>I will be with you alwaies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world;</hi> that is with his Church, in directing her chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in all their conſultations, relating either to the truth of her doctrine, or the manner of her diſcipline: wherefore if it ſhould be granted, that the Church had at any time determined amiſs; the Church cannot be ſaid to have erred, becauſe you muſt not take the particular time for the Catholick Church; becauſe the Church is as well Catholick for time as territory; except that you will make rectification an error.</p>
                  <p>For as in civil affairs, if that wee ſhould take advantage of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nulling former Acts; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conclude, that we will be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169830:71"/> by its lawes, we ſhould breed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the Common-wealth; for as they alter their lawes, upon experience of preſent inconveniences; ſo the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels cange their decrees according to that <hi>further knowledge</hi> which the holy writ aſſures us, ſhall encreaſe in the latter daies; provided that this knowledge he improved by means approved of, and not by every enthuſiastick, that ſhall oppoſe himſelf againſt the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>If I recall my own words, it is no error, but an avoidance of error: ſo where the ſame power rectifies it ſelfe, though ſome things formerly have been decreed amiſs, yet that cannot render the decrees of generall Councels not binding, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to error, <hi>quoad ad no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> though in themſelves, and <hi>protempore,</hi> they may be ſo.</p>
                  <p>As to Your Majeſties objecting the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the holy Apoſtles, and pen-men of the holy Ghost; and Your inference thereupon, viz. <hi>That truth is no where to be found but in holy Scripture;</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:169830:72"/> under Your Majeſties correction, I take this to be the greateſt argument againſt the private ſpirit (urged by your Majeſty) its leading us into all truth, that could poſſibly be found out. For if ſuch men (as they) indued with the holy Ghost, inabled with the power of working miracles; ſo ſanctyfied in their callings, and enlightened in their underſtandings could erre: how can any man (leſſe qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified) aſſume to himſelf a freedome from not erring, by the aſſiſtance of a private ſpirit?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as to Your Majeſties quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſo many Fathers, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures eaſines and plainneſſe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. If the Scriptures themſelves doe tell us, that they are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſo that <hi>the unleaned and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wreſt them to their own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> 2 Peter 3. 16. and if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> could not <hi>underſtand them except ſome man ſhould guide him:</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 13. and if the Scripture tels us, that Christs own
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169830:72"/> Diſciples could not underſtand them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Christ himſelf, <hi>expounds them unto them,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25. and if the Scriptures tell us, how the Angel wept much, <hi>becauſe no man was able either in heaven or earth to open the Book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, nor to look upon it:</hi> as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5. 1. then certainly all theſe ſayings of theirs are either to be ſet to the errata's that are be hind their books, or elſe we muſt look out ſome other meaning of their words, then what Your Majeſty hath inferr'd from thence; as thus they were eaſie <hi>id eſt in aliquibus,</hi> but not in <hi>omnibus locis;</hi> or thus, they were eaſie as to the attainment of particular ſalvation, but not as to the generall cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of all the divine myſtery therein contained, requiſite for the Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and by her alone, and her conſultations and diſcuſments (guided by an extraordinary and promiſed aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) only to be found out; of which as to every ordinary man, this knowledge is not neceſſary, ſo hereof he is not capable.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:169830:73"/>
                  <p> Firſt, we hold the reall preſence; you deny it: we ſay his body is there: you ſay there is nothing but bare bread: we have Scripture for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 26. <hi>Take eat this is my body,</hi> ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 19. <hi>This is my body which is given for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſay that the bread which we muſt eat in the Sacrament, is but dead bread; Chriſt ſaith that that bread <hi>is living bread:</hi> you ſay, <hi>how can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> we ſay that that was the objection of Jewes and Infidels (1 <hi>John</hi> 6. 25.) not of Chriſtians and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: you ſay it was ſpoken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; we ſay it was ſpoken really, <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> or as we tranſlate it <hi>indeed,</hi> John 6. 55. But as the Jewes did, ſo do ye, first <hi>murmur that Chriſt ſhould be bread, John</hi> 6. 41. Secondly, <hi>that that bread ſhould be fleſh,</hi> John 6. 52. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that that fleſh ſhould be meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> John 6. 55. untill at last you cry out with the unbelievers, <hi>this is a hard ſaying who can hear it?</hi> John 6. 60. had this been but a figure certainly Chriſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169830:73"/> would have removed the doubt, when he ſaw them ſo offended at the reallity: <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 61. He would not have confirmed his ſaying, <hi>in terminis,</hi> with promiſe of a greater wonder, <hi>John</hi> 6. 62. you may as well deny his incarnation, his aſcention, and ask, <hi>

                        </gap>ow could the man come down from heaven and go up again?</hi> (if incomprehenſibility ſhould be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to occaſion ſuch ſcruples in your breasts) and that which is worſe then naught, you have made our Saviours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion an argument againſt the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for where our Saviour tels them, thus to argue according unto fleſh and bloud, in theſe words, <hi>the fleſh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing;</hi> and that if they will be enlivened in their understanding, they muſt have faith to believe it in theſe words, <hi>it is the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> John 6. 63. They pervert our Saviours meaning into a contrary ſenſe, of their own imagination: <hi>viz. the fleſh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Chriſts body is not in the Sacrament:</hi> but <hi>it</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:169830:74"/> 
                     <hi>the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>we muſt onely believe that</hi> Chriſt <hi>dyed for us,</hi> but not that his body is there: as if there were any need of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inculcations, preſſures, offences, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believings, of and in a thing that were no more but a bare memoriall of a thing; being a thing nothing more uſuall with the Iſraelites; as the twelve ſtones which were errected as a ſign of the children of Iſraels paſſing over <hi>Jordan: That when your children ſhall ask their Fathers what is meant thereby, then ye ſhall anſwer them</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4. there would not have been ſo much difficulty in the belief, if there had not been more in the mystery; there would not have been ſo much offence taken at a memorandum, nor ſo much ſtumbling at a figure.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers are of this opinion, Saint <hi>Ignat.</hi> in Ep, <hi>ad Smir.</hi> Saint <hi>Juſtin. Apol:</hi> 2. <hi>ad Antonium:</hi> Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ser.</hi> 4. <hi>de lapſis.</hi> Saint <hi>Ambr. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Sacram.</hi> Saint <hi>Remigius, &amp;c.</hi> affirm <hi>the fleſh of Chriſt to be in the</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We hold tbat there is in the Church an infallible rule for underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, beſides the Scripture it ſelf: this you deny: this we have Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 16. we muſt <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie according to the rule of faith:</hi> we are bid to <hi>walke according to this rule:</hi> Gal. 6. 16. we muſt <hi>encreaſe our faith, and preach the Goſpel, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule: 1</hi> Cor. 10. 15, this <hi>rule of faith,</hi> the holy Scriptures call <hi>a form of doctrine:</hi> Romans 6. 17. a <hi>thing made ready to our hands:</hi> 2. Cor. 10. 16. <hi>that we may not meaſure our ſelves by our ſelves:</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 12. <hi>the depoſitions</hi> committed to the Churches trust, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of prophane and vain bablings and oppoſitions of ſciences,</hi> and by this <hi>rule of faith,</hi> is not meant the holy Scriptures; for that cannot do it, as the Apoſtle tels us, whilst there are <hi>unſtable</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:169830:75"/> men who wreſt this way and that way, <hi>to their own deſtruction;</hi> but it is the tradition of the Church and her expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is delivered from hand to hand as moſt plainly appears, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. viz. <hi>The things which thou haſt heard of us (not received in writing from me or others) among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithfull men, who ſhall be able to teach it to others alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this opinion are the Fathers; Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> 4. chap. 45. <hi>Tertull: de praeſcr.</hi> and <hi>Vnicent. lir. in ſuo commentario</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is very needfull in regard of ſo many errors proceeding from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations of Scripture, that the line of propheticall and Apoſtolicall expoſition, ſhould be directed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the Eccleſiaſticall and Catholike ſenſe;</hi> and ſaith. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> praeſcript. adverſ. haereſ. chap. 11. <hi>We do not admit our adverſaries to diſpute out of Scripture, till they can ſhew who their Anceſtors were,</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:169830:75"/> 
                     <hi>and from whom they received the Scriptures: for the ordinary courſe of doctrine, requires that the firſt queſtion ſhould be, from whom, and by whom, and to whom, the form of Chriſtian Religion was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; otherwiſe preſcribing againſt him as a ſtranger:</hi> for otherwiſe if a heathen ſhould come by the Bible, as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> came by the Propheſie of <hi>Eſay.</hi> and have no <hi>Philip</hi> to enterpret it unto him, he would find out a Religion rather according to his own fancy, then divine verritie.</p>
                  <p>In matters of faith, Christ bids us <hi>to obſerve and doe whatſoever they bid us who fit in Moſes ſeat</hi> Mat. 22. 2. therefore ſurely there is ſomething more to be obſerved then only Scripture; will you not as well believe what you hear Chriſt ſay, as what ye hear his Miniſters write; you hear Chriſt when you hear them, as well as you read Christ when you read his word: <hi>He that heareth you heareth me:</hi> Luke 10. 16.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:169830:76"/>
                  <p> We ſay the Scriptures are not eaſie to be underſtood; you ſay they are: we have Scripture for it, as is before manifeſted at large: the Fathers ſay as much: Saint <hi>Irenaeus</hi> lib. 2. chap. 47. <hi>Origen: contr.

                  </p>
                  <p>We ſay that this Church cannot erre: you ſay it can: we have Scripture for what we ſay; ſuch Scripture that will tell you that <hi>fools cannot erre therein:</hi> Eſaiah 35. 8. ſuch Scripture as will tell you, <hi>if you neglect to hear it, you ſhall be a heathen and a publican:</hi> Mat. 18.

                  <p> We grant you, that the Scripture is the Originall of all light: yet, we ſee light, before we ſee the Sun; and we know there was a light, when there was no Sun: the one is but the body of the other. We grant you, the Scriptures to be the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall globe, but we muſt not grant you that every one knowes how to uſe it, or that it is neceſſary or poſſible they ſhould. We grant that the Scripture is a light, to our feet, and a lanthorne to our paths: then you must grant me that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that we have a guide, or elſe we may loſe our way in the light, as well as in the darke. We grant you that it is the food of our ſouls, yet there muſt be ſome body that muſt divide, or break the bread. We grant you, that it is the only antidote againſt the infection of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, yet it is not every ones profeſſion to be a compounder of the ingredients. We grant Your Majeſty, the Scripture to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſword and buckler, to defend a Church from her Ghoſtly enemies: yet, I hope you will not have the glorious company
